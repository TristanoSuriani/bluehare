# Host tests of the Felucca sources (no hardware). Run from the repo root after ./build.sh:
#   tests/run_tests.sh
#
# Regression suite (tests/regress.c, tests/target_budget.py; details at the top of regress.c):
#   golden renders  every engine x preset, the GM map on DRUM, voice modes, FX sends, a 4-track mix: one hash
#                   each in tests/golden.txt. A change of the sound fails with the list of renders.
#   health          clipping, DC, peak level, voices free after the release, silence at the end.
#   CPU             instructions / sample per preset and mix (tests/cpu_baseline.txt, +25 %), ns printed;
#                   target: loop instructions of the render functions in the pi32v2 disassembly
#                   (tests/target_budget.txt, +10 %; exact, static).
#   voices          the budget of 8, steal fades, MONO / LEGATO / UNISON keep their note, the VOICE cap,
#                   no hanging notes on any MIDI / key routing.
# UI renders (tests/ui_render.c): every screen in every palette from the real drawing code: the layout lint (no text
#                   off the screen, cut, hidden, overlapping or spilling out of its cell / card; only free text
#                   ellipsised), GREY gray, MONO neutral, the draw cost, the text audit (build/ui_new/text_audit.tsv);
#                   PNGs of GREY MONO GREEN PAPER NIGHT in build/ui_new (tests/ui_render.py), the findings in build/ui_new/report.txt;
#                   FM6's 32 algorithm charts as drawn (no box overlapping, no route through a box or crossing another), again
#                   on OPERATOR with each operator picked and its frequency text at its widest (1.2, #76);
#                   every frame of the rolling digits (lint, GREY, MONO), their filmstrips in build/ui_slot;
#                   the alignment: every text / icon / keycap meant to be centred, or on its neighbours' line, by its
#                   ink against its box (cells, chips, buttons, rows, knobs, the roll's strip, the keycaps' pills), every
#                   screen in FLAT and LINE and every palette, over every value it can show; 1 px off or more fails
#                   (build/ui_new/align.txt). MENU > LARGE: every screen again (FLAT, LINE, every palette) and the page / value
#                   sweep with the tall cards, the same lint and alignment; sheet_LARGE_GREY.png, sheet_LARGE_MONO.png.
# UI (tests/ui_test.c): the UI sources against stub display / buttons / knobs: sound loads keep the track's
#                   ARP / SCL / SLICER, the sound's one-step undo (SAVE held), REC (arms only) on every page, ARP while
#                   recording, MIDI IN ROUT, saves refused while playing and the OVERWRITE? dialog, MUTE on TRACKS KNOB 1,
#                   FM6's operator pages (each byte alone, SLOT OWN, the sound, undo, the macros, projects / user presets).
# Audio / persistence / editor: the real C paths against simulated DMA and NOR flash: bounded overload
#                   fades, shared-voice limits, deferred settings and retries, failed-save rollback, the autosave
#                   (1.2: when it writes, the power-on restore, damaged copies, a write cut short, wear over a session),
#                   malformed transfers, transport-stop timeouts, MIDI and UART recovery; the MENU settings over the
#                   editor (MENU_DESC / MENU_SET: every item, clamping, unknown ids, saving, USB SERIAL applied later).
# FM6 BANK (tests/fm6bank_test.c, 1.4.1): the voice bank (src/fm6_vbank.c) and its editor commands against simulated NOR:
#                   written whole and read back, its sectors (0xE7000, staged in the autosave's older copy, nothing else
#                   touched), a power cut after any programmed byte or in any erase (the old bank or the new one, the
#                   autosave kept), a wrong CRC, an autosave between requests, SLOT B1..B32 loading the exact records,
#                   empty bank slots skipped / refused, projects and user presets keeping a bank voice, stored SLOT values
#                   (projects, user presets) loading as before.
# CHORD (tests/chord_test.c): the chord keys (src/chord.c): diatonic triads / sevenths of several scales and roots,
#                   the fixed shapes and voicings (at most 4 notes), names, MONO plays the root, a release ends
#                   exactly what its key / MIDI note started, recording, the ARP, MIDI IN, kits ignore CHRD.
# LFO 2 (tests/lfo2_test.c, 1.2): SYNC one cycle per note value at several tempi and on the external clock, OFF bit for bit
#                   as before; TRIG NOTE / FREE; POL UNI 0..+1, the matrix's AMP.
# TRACKER (1.5, in tests/ui_test.c test_tracker_*): LOOP and SONG playback (rows of a 1/16, swing, notes ringing to the next
#                   or OFF, the pattern cued, the order list round), a row's instrument and its one-row FX, the tracks' CUT,
#                   live recording into the rows, the pages' knobs / PRESETS / EDIT / keys, the cursor following the
#                   playing row a page of 8 at a time, the song saved and loaded whole (too big: refused; damaged: refused).
# MOD (tests/mod_test.c): the modulation matrix: slots that do nothing are bit-identical, every source on each
#                   kind of destination, clamping, MIDI CC1 / CC11 / aftertouch routing, the cost of 4 active
#                   slots (at most +5 %), demos in build/mod_demo/.
# SOUND (tests/sound14_test.c; #132 #104 #148): the matrix's S&H / SLEW sources (a value per LFO cycle, the glide) and
#                   DEPTH destination (the LFO's gain; none = untouched), ANALOG WAVE SYNC / SUB (pitch, no DC, bounded,
#                   the band-limited restart), SPREAD (SPRD 0 / MONO / LEGATO bit for bit, a note hard left / right, the
#                   mono sum, UNISON, the SLICER's gate and the mute key on both sides, mono sends), the cost; demos in
#                   build/sound14_demo/.
# PERFORM (tests/perform_test.c): the FX hold layer (src/perform.c): 1/16 starts, stereo buffer effects, the
#                   too-long REPEAT, the SLICER interplay, silent layer keys, idle bit-identical, cost; build/perform_demo/;
#                   OCT UP / DN (the harmonizer): pitch, stereo, clicks, the shimmer bounded, cost; FLANGER / PHASER (1.2): no DC,
#                   bounded, the sweep in time with the tempo, clean release, stacked with REPEAT / LPF / HPF, cost; the key
#                   map (any effect or none on any key, a key remapped while held, FX LATCH); build/fx_demo/.
# REVERB (tests/reverb_test.c): REVERB TYPE (src/fx.c): ROOM bit for bit as before, SPRING's decay against SIZE,
#                   its chirp (group delay rising with frequency), stability at the corners, level, a model change
#                   without a click, its cost against ROOM (+30 % at most); demos in build/fx_demo/. 1.2's HALL: SPRING
#                   bit for bit as before, decay against SIZE and DAMP, stability, exact silence after the tail (27
#                   settings and levels), no offset, level, stereo, echo density / ringing / flutter against ROOM, SPRING
#                   and COMB8 (8 combs + 4 allpasses, host only, for comparison), model changes both ways, cost; the
#                   listening set in build/reverb_demo/ (drums, pluck, piano: dry and each model at SIZE 40 / 90 / 127).
# INPUT (tests/input_test.c): the key / button debounce of hal/fm1_input.h against the TIMER5 scan and bouncing
#                   contacts: a press within 2 scans (<= 2.3 ms), one note per bouncy press, no early or hanging
#                   release, stray samples ignored, fast repeats, the encoders' detents; the LED scan: lit LEDs every
#                   frame, dim ones a short pulse (the second line write) every frame, each only on its own column;
#                   the breath (#119): dark .. ~60 % of lit (DIM LO ~30 %), smooth, no dark run over ~10 ms near its peak;
#                   the power-on sweep (1.1, hal/fm1_led_anim.h): its length, every LED every frame at its level, the
#                   head left to right with its tail, the buttons, the end on the idle glow, the tick as before after;
#                   the idle animation (1.2, MENU > ANIM IDLE): endless, every LED every frame, the light there and back,
#                   the buttons breathing, a key down ends it before its next frame.
# CLICK (tests/click_test.c, 1.1): the metronome (src/click.c, src/seq.c) through audio.c: each beat at the first
#                   sample of its block, with a 1/16 track's steps 1 5 9 13 (internal and external clock, DIV 1/8 and
#                   SWING too), the accent, the frequencies, length, LEVEL, MASTER, OFF / REC / ON, USB audio bit for bit
#                   without it; 1.5: no count-in (PLAY armed plays at once); build/click_demo/.
# USB audio (tests/uac_test.c): the UAC1 descriptors as a host parses them (with and without CDC; 44100 and
#                   48000 Hz), the ring and packetiser: 44.1 frames per packet, every frame in order (bit for bit),
#                   underrun / overrun, restart; SET_CUR; the 44.1 -> 48 kHz resampler (every frame against a
#                   double-precision one, response, SNR, cost); the stream at 48 kHz (47..49 frames per packet,
#                   fast and slow I2S clocks, switching rates mid-stream).
# web (web/test_web.mjs): the editor protocol against its mock device, whose tables must equal the
#                   firmware's (tests/descdump.c -> build/host/desc.json; the MENU settings: tests/editor_test.c -> build/host/menu.json),
#                   the package builder, the updater.
# Browser emulator (web/emu, when emcc is there): the firmware in WebAssembly (build/emu) boots, plays keys and MIDI,
#                   draws, lights its LEDs, keeps a save across instances, plays a song bit for bit as the same file
#                   built with cc (web/emu/native_check.c); the cost of 1 s of a heavy song against real time.
# PHYS (tests/phys_test.c): stability over the whole parameter and pitch range, the worst-case cost against
#                   the heaviest factory preset, demos in build/phys_demo/; tests/phys_ref.cpp compares the
#                   fixed-point models with DaisySP's float originals when DaisySP is there (DAISYSP=path).
# DRUM (tests/drum_test.c): the drum voices (src/drum_voice.c): pitch, decay, centroid and level against
#                   Felucca's targets, the controls' directions, no clipping, DC, retriggers, the hat choke, the
#                   kick on a small speaker; the DRUM engine (src/eng_drum.c): its key map, the 8 lanes together,
#                   one hit per lane, the choke between lanes; the cost per voice; demos in build/drum_demo/.
# NOISE (tests/noise_test.c): the engine (src/eng_noise.c): COLR's slope (white, pink, brown), the filter and the
#                   register clock following the key, META periodic at the key, no DC, no clipping at the
#                   corners, a note from silence the same twice, the cost per voice; demos in build/noise_demo/.
# FM6 (tests/fm6_test.c): the 6-operator FM engine (src/eng_fm6.c, src/fm6_core.c): the 32 algorithms' carriers, the
#                   operator envelopes (stages, rates, the voice ending), bit-stable notes, a click-free retrigger, no DC /
#                   clipping over the factory patches, the macros' directions, PTCH, pack / unpack and the SysEx
#                   layouts, the 6-voice cap, the cost per voice; demos in build/fm6_demo/.
# ENGINES (tests/engines_test.c): the IDM distribution (FELUCCA_DIST=idm, no VOICE TRIO WHEEL HOOVER): its engines
#                   numbered from 0 in its order, the ids both ways, a left-out engine's sound loading as its substitute
#                   (projects, G_ENGSEL / PRESET, the song's instruments), its user presets kept but not listed, every
#                   engine left rendering.
# ROBUST (tests/robust_test.c): damaged or crafted stored data and editor requests: a song's fields out of range refused (an engine past the
#                   last, no position, an unknown FX) under a valid hash, values loaded inside their ranges, user preset
#                   patterns inside their fields, malformed requests never stop PLAY.
# Sanitizers (ASan + UBSan, when the compiler has them; SANITIZE=0 skips): the stored-data and protocol tests again
#                   (loader, M-UPGRADE entry, editor, projects, backup, ROBUST) and three short fuzz runs with fixed
#                   seeds: tests/fuzz_ed.c (editor SysEx and raw USB-MIDI packets), tests/fuzz_proj.c (random songs, their
#                   stored chunks mutated -> find -> load -> play -> render). Longer runs: build/host/asan/fuzz_ed 300000 7 (iterations, seed), the same for the others.
#                   UBSan leaves out the DSP's intended wraps (signed overflow, shifts, bounds, object-size,
#                   pointer-overflow).
# Change baseline entries only for reviewed, intentional differences in sound or cost;
# retain every unaffected golden / CPU / target entry. VERBOSE=1: every render.
